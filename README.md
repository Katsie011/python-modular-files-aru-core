# Welcome to modularised code
---

<sub> Note that this is a temporary home for this code until it can be placed on the central ARU page<sub>
  
The idea of this repo is to reduce the reduncancy of code at UCT's Mechatronics Lab for work on the Husky Robot. 

Feel free to improve on any of the code you find here and issue a pull request. 
Create a new feature or branch if you are writing code for something else.
